        <p>When you think of Halloween the first thing that comes to mind is trick or treating. 
            The practice of pestering your neighbors to give you candy under an undefined threat of a trick if they do not comply.
            By running this gambit on multiple homes nearby children acquire large quantities of candy.</p>

        <p>It is common to see many people dressed in unusual attire on this holiday. 
            What originated as an attempt to disguise one's self from any number of harmful 
            other worldly entities as the walls that seperate our world from the unknowable horrors 
            that linger on the edge of our reality has now become a chance to embody something you are not.</p>

             the only actual rituals that occur are the ones of each individual's way to celebrate each year.</p>
