        <h2>About Sophia</h2>
        <p>Sophia Cook is a student at McHenry County College who is pursuing a 
            certificate in Web Development. She has a variety of interests and 
            hobbies ranging from theatre to camping. 
            To highlight a few
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Singing</li>
            <li>Historical Reenactment</li>
            <li>Boardgames</li>
        </ul>
        <p> These favorites often overlap to form unique experiences such as 
            performing songs about events that happen in her historical 
            reenactment group. Sophia values community deeply and aims to 
            foster it wherever she goes. This sense of community has had an 
            impact on all her interests. Whether it is in a historical 
            reenactment group, a choir, or her own family, she strives to 
            create a place where people can gather and support each other. 
            Being a member of the LGBTQ+ community, Sophia understands the 
            importance of supporting one another. <br> If you would like to
